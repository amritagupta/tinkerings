I am a PhD candidate in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, advised by [Bistra Dilkina](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dilkina/Bistra). I research how to enable data-driven decision making, particularly in sustainability areas like biodiversity conservation planning and disaster preparedness. My main website can be found [here](http://www.amritagupta.com). Sometimes I tinker with data and code for fun. This site is a collection of those tinkerings.
